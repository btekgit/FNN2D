# FNN2D

This is the code repository of 2D Adaptive Local Connected Neuron Paper. 
Code is based on Tensorflow 2+ and Keras. 
utility code is also supplied. 

To try our code simply run the main file. 
Focus2D_tf2_v2.py
It will create a simple 2 layer network and train on MNIST. 

We will provide more information in the future.
